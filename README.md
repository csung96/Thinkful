## Introduction:
As a recent college graduate, I wanted to learn and gain more knowledge and skills in the data science field. In order to do so, I decided to enroll in the Thinkful Data Science program where I practice and grasp a better understanding of materials and programs related to Data science. This is my notes to the different units and lessons along with different capstone projects I have worked on during the program. 

## Requirements
