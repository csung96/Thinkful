WHAT IS DATABASE?
* stores data
Operations, Storage and Analytics
* operational service consists of several different aspects, one of them is to gaather and write data
* could be the sign up info gathered on website or data about placement of ad
* not typically designed to store that info, so it has to write it out somewhere (database)

many advantages of database over a local file system for storing data:
1. can be distributed across many machines and have a higher capacity than any single machine
2. mult users can access remote database at the same time and access the same 'truth'
3. databases can also take data from mult sources and store all that data in a single system
4. powerful tool for formatting and organizing data, making it far more comprehensible to users

database typically consists of series of tables, each table with its own defined schema (or organization)and a number of 'records' (rows):
* TABLE is set of rows and columns populated with data
* data is consistently org according to the oclumns with column def remaining constant throughout the table
* that organization is called the SCHEMA
* one diff is that database schemas can be somewhat involved to change, particularly when dealing with large databases, and changes can cause problems unless carefully excuted. 
*good schema is tricky to define but goes a long way to enabling  good analytics
* each RECORD (row) of data in a table will conform to the table's schema
* ideally all rows of data in a table would have an entry in every FIELD or column except NULL or N/A

Different kinds of tables; 
1. raw tables: these contain data in least processed form possible, usually loaded into database as simply as possible
2. processed table: some work has been done to transform data into more readable and usable form
3. roll-up tables: specific kind of processed table, which take data and aggregate it in some more comprehensible or useful way



MEET SQL:
* very little that happens with database itself; data is just sitting there
* to get data into more useful env, youll need to write queries. 

Queries: requests for specific parts of database plus if you choose manipulating that data in useful ways
* WL = language the global std for quaring
