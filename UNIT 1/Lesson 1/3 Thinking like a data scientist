TLADS- think like a data scientist (show how to take lesson's concept and implement it data scientist style)

approach problems from 3 perspectives
* Curiosity: engine behind why and how questions; to know more than what we can see or understand right now
* Practicality: make sure to define Q's in ways that are amenable to data oriented solutions
* Skepticism: not only describe what seems to be happening in dataset but also how much confidence we can place in results we see

MAKING REAL LIFE QUESTIONS TESTABLE: 
* provide concrete def of bad things, such as being the victim of a crime
* provide a concrete def of good people such as people who volunteer once a month or more
* collect data, find existing dataset , continaing data from ppl who were and werent victims of crimes and do and do not volunteer once a month or more
