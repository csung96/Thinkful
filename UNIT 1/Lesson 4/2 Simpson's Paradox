imagine analyzing gender differences in university's admissions for grad progrrams
* compute proportion of successful female applciants and compare it to the proportion of successful male applicants and get following
     M: 8442 applicants; 44% admitted
     F: 4321 applicants; 35% admitted
* overall women are less likely to be admitted to grad programs at university than men
* intrigued, dig deeper and compute prop of successful applicatnts of each gender for each grad program separatley
Department  Male Applicants  Male Admitted   Female Applicants  Female Admitted
A                 825            62%               108               82%
B                 560            63%               25                68%
C                 325            37%               593               34%
D                 417            33%               375               35%
E                 191            28%               393               24%
F                 373            6%                341                7%

* when broken down by department, women appear ot have same or slighly better chance of being admitted than men (exact opposite of what we observed before)
* at this point we have to start checking your code errors, but theres no need
* Example of SIMPSONS PARADOX

Simpson's Paradox: phenomenon when avg over a number of groups shows one trend but avg for each individual group shows opposite trend
* another name = 'Lurking Variable Problem'
* where an unaccounted for third variable changes the rel b/w two other variables

in ex: third variable = total number of men and women that applied to each program. 
* looking at numbers above, many more men than women applied to programs A and B which had high admittance rates.
* women were more likely to apply to programs with low admittance rates
* means overall, a man had greater chance of being admitted not b/c cause he was a man but b.c he was likely to apply to program that admitted a high %



another ex: changes in the median wage
* from 2000 to 2013, median wage rose slightly
* yet during same period, median wage for every educational group (HS dropouts, HS grad, college grad) went down
* the lurking variable here is demographic changes in US over that period-- a greater prop of americans had college degrees in 2013 than 2000
* since people with college degrees get paid on avg more than ppl with only HS diploma, overall median wage could rise for pop even as it dropped for each group

LESSON of Simpson's Paradox: pay attention to how groups differ from one another before averaging across them 
* averaging a small group with a large one or averaging multiple groups with very different demographics can produce unexpected or illogical results
* use randomization to avoid simpsons paradox
