T-VALUES
* in previous module, w derived p-values from t-values, taking both tails of the t-dist
* why look at both the pos and neg t-value?
    * default t-test is "two tailed"
    * means that it test the likelihood of getting a value "more extreme" than t
      value in either direction
* if there is no possibility of getting a neg t-value, then you can use a one-tailed p-value which means the p-value is calc by summing the area under the curve of only one of the two tails. 
    * one tailed test would be appropriate when comparing an avg weight to 0
    * for the t-value to be neg, the avg weight would also have to be neg
* typically the two tailed t-test is used, under the assump that it is better to be conservative (get higher p-values than we should) than to be too liberal (lower p-values)

PHILOSOPHY OF NULL HYPOTHESIS SIGNIFICANCE TESTING
* typical interpretation of p-values ("less than .05 m3eans my hypothesis was right") works fairly well in practical terms
* however its important to know that interpretation is wrong
* the p-value rep the prob of getting the data you have if the null hyp were true
* the null hyp is typically a no effect hyp
* that means that when the p-value is less than .05, there is less than 5% chance of getting your part data by random chance even though there was no effect in the pop
* leads us to reject null hyp of no effect

* not that there is no mention of the actual hyp (there is an effect and it is X) anywhere in there
* the entire edifice of NULL HYP SIG TESTING that culminates in p-values is almost completely agnostic to the content of your actual hypothesis
* all NHST allows the person to do is to conclude that there is probably not no effec
* in the universe of NHST the actual effect, could be anything at all

happily our actual hyp does come into play in another way
* purpose of an exp such as A/B test is to create a situation where there are only two possible outcomes
* if your hyp is correct, outcome X will occur, while if null is correct, X will not occur
* if the possibility space is indeed limited to oly those two potential outcomes, then rejecting null hyp (X did not occr) may be considered tantamount to accepting the hyp (X occured) 

however, can never limit the possibility space to just two outcomes
