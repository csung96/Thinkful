TYPES OF NAIVE BAYES
* When running the Naive Bayes classifier, you will need to make another assumption. 
* Assumption is about the distribution of P(xi|y)

Three main classifiers: 
1. Bernoulli (Binomial)
2. Multinomial
3. Gaussian Naive (Normal)

The distributions have limitations
* Binomial can only take 2 values
* Multinomial has discrete outcomes
* Guissian takes values along the cont norm dist

Choosing which kind of classifer you want depends on dist of your outcome variable
    * Choose the dist that best fits your data!
    
    
IMPROVING PERFORMANCE
* Improe performance of your model
    * feature engineering: to draw out the right features for the model
    * feature selection also important
        * features equally weighted--> highly corr features can lead to doubling the
          impact of what is essentially a single feature. 
        * Assumption is that every pair of variables in independent from each other
        * The more removed--> the more problems you will run into
        

DOWNSIDE: 
* Assumption of independence
    * It is a condition you'll often fail to have, but also means that any time two variables affect outcome most in concert, model will fail to see it
    * This is called an interaction (occurs when any two features create a different effect when they both have a specific value than they would as independent occurances) 
    * Naive can only predict outcome of categories it has seen before.
