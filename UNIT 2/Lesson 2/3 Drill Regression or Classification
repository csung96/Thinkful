1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.
    * Regression: continuous outcome variable
    * Can compare values and calculate mean rather than how many times each
      discrete value occurs. 
2. What color car someone is going to buy.
    * Discrete outcome from a set--> Classification
    * Can see which color has max
3. How many children a family will have.
    * Both
    * Classification: since number of chilren can come from a set of discrete
      possible outcomes
    * Regression: to find the average
4. If someone will sign up for a service.
    * outcome will only be {Yes, No, Maybe} --> discrete --> classification
5. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
    * Most likely want to find mean so we will use continuous numbers -->
      regression
6. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
    * Put outome on bounded/unbounded line
    * Continuous outcome variable--> Regression
7. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
    * Classification --> discrete set of outcome variables {A, B, C}
